## 🚌 Auckland Bus Accessibility Using Shiny
Welcome! 👋 This repository explores how Auckland's bus routes operate and quantifies spatial accessibility at popular sites, including the CBD and suburbs like Mount Eden. 🚍

As an undergraudate summer research project, we’ve developed an interactive Shiny app to visualise and understand the dynamics of accessibility across the city. Whether you're a transport planner, urban analyst, or just curious about Auckland's public transport system, this project offers valuable insights! 🌏

🧐 Why This Matters
